# Bike-and-Car-Purchasing-Preferences-with-Age-Gender-and-Income
About my first project on Github, This project is made on excel. The data contains Information about how much people buy a car based on their income, gender and age. According to the visual analysis the people who are young not prefer to buy bike. However as they become middle aged they like to buy a lot of bike. Similarly the graph shows a downward trend when person becomes old.
According to the analysis the Females are more likely to buy a car if they travel 1 to 2 miles. However as distance increase womwn tend to buy less cars. However as distance increases men are buying more cars.
